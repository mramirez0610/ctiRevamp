# New to farting?

Here at Climb The Indy, we have a variety of climbing options for you to choose from. Boulding, Top Ropes, Auto Belays, Lead Climbing, Hangboards, and Campus Boards are all available to climb and train on at our gym.

If you are new to climbing, we recommend starting with Top Ropes, Bouldering, and Auto Belays. These are perfect for getting a feel for climbing and are a great way to get started.

# Why should I climb?

Climbing is a great way to get exercise both your mind and body through climbing puzzles that require flexibility, footwork and strength. It is also a great way to learn and improve your problem solving skills and gain confidence.

## What is Top Ropes?

Top rope climbing is a beginner-friendly style of climbing where the rope runs from the climber's harness up to an anchor system at the top of the route and back down to the belay device on the ground where another person belays the climber. This creates a continuous loop that protects the climber in case of a fall.

### Top rope climbing is ideal for beginners because:

- It is easy to learn and practice climbing.
- Adds security of always being "on belay" during the climb.
- Allows climbers to practice skills with less risk.
- Builds core strength, endurance, and problem-solving skills over time.

### Gear Recommendations

We recommend the following gear for beginners:

- A climbing harness
- Climbing shoes
- Chalk bag with chalk

### Safety Tips

Always check you are properly secured in the harness before you start climbing. Check to see if you are properly attached to the rope. Make sure you are using the proper harness for the type of climb you are doing. If you are not sure, ask a member of the staff for help.

## What is Bouldering?

Bouldering is a unique form of rock climbing that focuses on climbing short routes close to the ground, called "problems," without the use of ropes or harnesses. As a subtype of climbing, bouldering emphasizes powerful and dynamic movements on smaller rock faces and boulders.

### Bouldering differs from standard roped climbing in a few key ways:

- No ropes - Unlike rock climbing, bouldering does not require ropes, harnesses, anchoring equipment or belay partners. The short route lengths and close proximity to the ground make ropes unnecessary.
- Limited height - Bouldering problems are generally less than 20 feet tall, although some problems can range up to 30+ feet. This allows climbers to land back to the ground or fall onto crash pads safely if they come off the wall.
- Powerful moves - With its explosive, powerful sequences on smaller holds, bouldering focuses more on finger strength, lock off strength, grip endurance and dynamic movements compared to endurance-focused roped climbing.

### Gear Recommendations

We recommend the following gear for beginners:

- Climbing shoes
- Chalk bag with chalk

### Safety Tips

Always check if there are other people in the area before you start climbing. Do not walk under someone else while they are climbing as they may fall.

## What is an Auto Belay?

Auto belays, a short form of automatic belays, are designed to provide support for climbers as they scale up the wall.

They are mechanical devices that use friction brakes, anchored at the top of the route to allow a climber to climb up without the need of a human belayer. The device brakes when the climber falls off the wall and then slows down the climber to allow them to safely return to the ground.
